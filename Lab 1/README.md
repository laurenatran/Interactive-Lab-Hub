# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 


### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.


## Part A. Plan 


\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Our original brainstorming storyboards center on an alarm clock that wakes up the user using a light of their choice. We wanted to be able to imitate a sunny wake up for users who live in dark, gloomy areas like Seattle or a relaxed, rainy day wake up for users who live in sunny areas like California. The idea is that no matter where a person lives, the alarm will imitate their desired wake up weather conditions.

 Our intended users are academics and professionals who want to wake up in a healthy, non jarring way through light rather than sound. Additionally, our users are people who may not live in the ideal weather setting of their choice but want to mimic their ideal morning weather, whether it's a sunny, bright day or a cool, rainy day. 


\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*
Storyboards: 
The storyboards depict various wake up scenarios where a users is woken up by a light of their choice (warm and yellow versus cool and blue)

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
Our original idea was to simply wake up users with a bright white light. However, on examining this situation, we realized that a bright white light would be a jarring wakeup, almost as jarring as waking up with a loud noise which is the situation our users are trying to avoid. As a result, we changed our idea from a bright white light to colored lights of various intensities that would allow users to choose the intensity of their light wake up. 


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
One issue we ran into when setting up this prototype was that the light source was not strong enough to wake someone up, especially if the device is set on a bedside table, similar to where an alarm clock normally is. To compensate, we decided to add more light sources around the room that would fill the room with the desired amount of light rather than having one, singular, weak light source. 

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
Get a stronger light source ie: projecting the desired light throughout the room. This was hard to model with the prototype, but the end goal is the device has a projector feature that floods the room with the chosen light color and strength: such as a light purple all across the ceiling, walls, etc at a brightness of 100000 nits. This setting should be controlled and set by the user based on their preferences.
We also hope to include in future iterations an additional light signal after the user wakes up. This second light source will portray the temperature of the outside environment. Red for hot, green or purple for temperate, and blue for cold. The user will be able to customize his or her preferences: ie: Mayur thinks that above 50 F is actually really hot (whereas some people might think over 80F is hot)! So a red light will go on if it’s 51 degrees outside. This way, a user will know how the temperature is relative to his or her own preferences rather than regular temperature standards.


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
The tinkerbell application was not very compatible with the school wifi as the wifi sets up profiles and makes it so we cannot connect to tinkerbell through our phones without the use of a hotspot.


\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
First take:

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
 We made changes to the user interaction of the device and how bright our light source was. We also discussed potential options for showing the secondary source of light after the user wakes up indicating the temperature outside.

## Part E. Costume the device


\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
We wanted the user to have minimal interaction with the device and to have a pleasant experience waking up. By incorporating 3 buttons to select the lighting type, we reduce the complexity of the device and make the choice easier. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
